# Arudino-Logic-Game
A simple logic guessing game implemented on Arudino during freshman year. DemoVideo.mov contains a demonstration of the game. I recieved an O (outstanding) grade for this project in my Applied Electronics Lab.

Gameplay - The user must guess a sequence of 4 buttons that has been set randomly by the game. After each guess, the game will provide information about the guess. Some of the green lights in the board will flash to indicate some presses were guessed correctly (1, 2, or 4). Using this info, the user can improve their guess.
